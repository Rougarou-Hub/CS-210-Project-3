This project was an interesting one, yet what it asked was very simple. You had to make a program that analyzed text records for a grocery store, and it had to keep order chronologically, as they wanted to redo their produce section. 
I think I did well in keeping the code, and the program very simple. It felt extremely user friendly, and just about anyone could use it in my opinion.
I could likely enchance this code by simplifying it where possible, to make sure it runs as smoothly as possible.
With C++ I find the entire language to be far more difficult then anything i've had to write with thus far, I found that the amount of symbols and terms was sometimes overwhelming.
My skills in writing improved with this project, and the others from the term.
I think that by following our prompt, and keeping things simple, I achieved these three goals.
